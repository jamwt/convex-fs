<Aside type="caution">
  ConvexFS is currently alpha software. Things mostly work, but there are some
  rough edges. The API may change slightly over time as we learn more about how
  people use it.

We're actively working on it and would love your feedback. Please
[open an issue](https://github.com/jamwt/convex-fs/issues) or
[join our Discord](https://discord.gg/convex) to let us know what you think.
