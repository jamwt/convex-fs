description: How to upload files to ConvexFS from your application.

import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

Let's break down the detailed steps for uploading one file:

1.  Your app, in the browser, `POST`s a file to the component's registered blob
    upload handler. (In our examples, this is handler is mounted at
    `/fs/upload`.)
1.  If the component successfully writes the blob to bunny.net, it will return a
    JSON object back to the app, like so: `{blobId: "XXXX"}`. This blobId is a
    UUIDv4 that represents the raw file data.
1.  Your app now calls a simple mutation in your Convex backend like
    `api.files.commitFile({path: "/myfile.jpg",blobId:"XXXX"})`.
1.  This mutation uses the ConvexFS instance `fs` to invoke
    `fs.commitFiles(ctx, [{path: "/myfile.jpg",blobId:"XXXX"}])`.

And when that mutation succeeds, that path will successfully reference that
blobId.

<Aside>
  If we had uploaded two or more blobs, and wanted to commit them all at the
  same time, our app could have a mutation that passes through multiple blobId +
  path pairs to the underlying `ConvexFS` method. But we'll go much deeper on
  those kinds of use cases [later](/guides/transactions-atomicity).

Let's look at the bare minimum code on the frontend and backend to actually
implement this flow.

## The `commitFile` mutation

The mutation is as easy as it gets—granted, we're not handling
[authentication](/guides/authn-authz) yet.

In `convex/files.ts`:

```tsx
import { v } from "convex/values";
import { action } from "./_generated/server";
import { fs } from "./fs";
export const commitFile = action({
  args: {
    blobId: v.string(),
    filename: v.string(),
  },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    const path = "/" + args.filename; // or whatever path structure you want
    await fs.commitFiles(ctx, [{ path, blobId: args.blobId }]);
  },
});
```

## The react app

Here's a very simple React component that uses a `file` input to upload a single
file:

```tsx
import { useState } from "react";
import { useAction } from "convex/react";
import { api } from "../convex/_generated/api";
function FileUpload() {
  const [uploading, setUploading] = useState(false);
  const commitFile = useAction(api.files.commitFile);

  // Derive the .site URL from your Convex URL
  const siteUrl = (import.meta.env.VITE_CONVEX_URL ?? "").replace(
    /\.cloud$/,
    ".site",
  );

  const handleUpload = async (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
    const file = e.target.files?.[0];
    if (!file) return;
    setUploading(true);
    try {
      // 1. Upload blob to ConvexFS endpoint
      const res = await fetch(`${siteUrl}/fs/upload`, {
        method: "POST",
        headers: { "Content-Type": file.type },
        body: file,
      });
      const { blobId } = await res.json();

      // 2. Commit the file to a path
      await commitFile({
        blobId,
        filename: file.name,
      });
      alert("Upload complete!");
    } catch (err) {
      alert("Upload failed: " + (err as Error).message);
    } finally {
      setUploading(false);
    }
  };
  return <input type="file" onChange={handleUpload} disabled={uploading} />;
}
export default FileUpload;
```

## What's next

Now that you've uploaded a file, let's [serve it](/guides/serving-files)!
