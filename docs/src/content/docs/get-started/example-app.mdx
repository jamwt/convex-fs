## Example

The best way to test your bunny.net integration and to learn the ConvexFS basics
is by getting the example app working.

## Clone the repo ConvexFS project repo.

If you haven't already, use `git` to clone the repo on your machine:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/jamwt/convex-fs
```

## Get the app installed and running

Launch the app in the normal Convex way:

```bash
$ npm i
$ npm run dev
```

The `run dev` command will run both the vite frontend and the `npx convex dev`
command in the background.

As usual, `npx convex dev` will make sure you're logged in, help you set up a new Convex
project, and deploy the project to a development environment.

## Set the bunny.net environment variables.

Your app is running, but it doesn't work—yet! We need to introduce those
variables and keys from [the bunny.net setup](/get-started/setup-bunny) into our
Convex backend.

If your Convex project dashboard isn't already loaded in your browser, you can pop it up at any
time from the terminal in your project root by running:

```bash
$ npx convex dashboard
```

Then, in the dashboard, click **Settings** in the left nav, and choose **Environment Variables**.
Finally, set those four variables from the CDN setup using the management UI:

<Aside type="tip">Remember, if you're using a non-default (non-Frankfurt) storage zone
region, you'll need to set `BUNNY_REGION` in the dashboard as well.</Aside>

## Try the app!

Navigate to [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) and drag and drop
some images! You should see them upload and then populate into your file view.
You can try renaming, copying, and deleting your image files.

It should look a little like this:
